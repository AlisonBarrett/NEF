CCPN test data

CCPN_H1GI_clean.nef and CCPN_Sec5Part3.nef 

are both CCPN 'working projects'. They are the export of a complete project as it would accumulate
(minus any CCPN-specific tags), rather than the smaller and more targeted files you would
produce for transfer to a specific program or depositions system. Not all the content will be
relevant for all other programs, but this is the kind of files you may encounter.

CCPN_H1GI_clean.nef is a mature project with assignnments, assigned peaks, restraints, and
the results of violation analysis.

CCPN_Sec5Part3.nef is an early project with the kind of assignments you would expect while
still assigning the spectrum.

For an example that exercises all the tags in the formats, use 
specification/Commented_Example.nef
