This is a fairly inclusive file with one chemical shift list, two unassigned noesy peak lists, a noe restraint list, rdc list, and linkage table.

In the peak lists, I have included a tag that has not yet been indoctrinated into the NEF format, but was discussed during the Osaka conference. Namely, I have included "_nef_peak.is_restraint" which serves as a binary to indicate if that peak was used in a restraint, 0 meaning it was not and 1 meaning it was.

On the topic of peak lists, I have not included any assignments for the time being.
